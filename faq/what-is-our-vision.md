# What is our vision?

We are working to build a better future for the world of sports, to develop an ecosystem that encourages athletes and replaces existing infrastructures.&#x20;

We want to help people in underdeveloped countries and those who have limited access to sports during the development stage  by utilizing the eco-system we have created.

To achieve this, we plan to organize competitions and events to ensure that they reach people in need.

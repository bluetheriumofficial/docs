# Whitepaper v1.01

Sports is one of the most common and effective social institutions of modern society, the individual being it’s most important entity.&#x20;

Only societies with healthy, educated and cultured individuals can be considered to be modern.&#x20;

While it’s main purpose is to contribute to the physical, mental and social development of humanity, sports is also a very effective social tool for creating this society.&#x20;

In addition to their benefits and roles for the individual, sports also have a very important social duty.&#x20;

It’s evident that there is a significant relationship between the way modern people do sports and how sophisticated a society is.&#x20;

The purpose of this project is to reveal the social functions and dimensions of sports in third world countries that lack sufficient endorsement, to solve the problem of accessibility of younger generations’ access to sports, and to contribute to global social sports aid organizations.

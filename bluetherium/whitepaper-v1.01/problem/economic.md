#### [Lack of Facilities: ](economic.md#lack-of-facilities)

There are insufficiencies in the quantity and quality of facilities that athletes have access to.&#x20;

The fact that there is only a limited number of facilities that athletes can access in their home countries makes it difficult for them to progress, and the lack of resources necessary for certain sports branches in their hometowns cause great disadvantages for the training of potential athletes.&#x20;

#### [Lack of Equipment: ](economic.md#lack-of-equipment)

One of the main shortcomings that affect the quality of the athletes’ sports experiences, as mentioned above, is the fact that athletes cannot reach the equipment required for their goals causing decreased performance and preventing the necessary development that is a vital part of personal development.&#x20;

#### [Athletes’ Financing: ](economic.md#athletes-financing)

Professional and amateur athletes who participate in less popular sports branches in their home country find it hard to find sponsor support, and the inadequacy of an athlete's financial condition often leads them to quit or to change the sports branch that they are initially interested in, especially in cases where when they cannot find financial aid.&#x20;

#### [Insufficient Ergogenic Support: ](economic.md#insufficient-ergogenic-support)

Lack of financing affects the continuity of the athletes’ development.&#x20;

Perhaps the biggest detrimental impact on the development of athletes is the lack of funding to obtain ergogenic support, also leading to nutrition deficiency.&#x20;

#### [Health Assurance: ](economic.md#health-assurance)

Athletes, especially in sports branches other than popular ones usually face health burdens if their own families do not have health insurance, or if they don’t have sufficient financing.&#x20;

\*In most cases there is also an absence of health insurance policies that is enough to cover all of the athletes’ needs, regardless of their branch.&#x20;

#### [Insufficient Federation Budget: ](economic.md#insufficient-federation-budget)

There is often a lack of budget allocation for most sports branches in federations.&#x20;

This inadequacy causes the athlete or sports club to face obstacles while preparing for competitions, to finance the athletes, the club and the competition, and to provide for transportation and accommodation.

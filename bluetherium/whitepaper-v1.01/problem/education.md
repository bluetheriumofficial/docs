#### Lack of trainers:

There is usually a shortage of specialized trainers in various sports branches due to lack of financing.&#x20;

The excess number of athletes per trainer affects both the quality and the amount of time allocated per individual athlete, causing inadequate physiology, nutrition and culture, creating athletes who are not competent in the science of training, who lack basic sports knowledge and those with insufficient education.&#x20;

The lack of training directly affects the success of the sports branch, and the decreases the continuity and health of the athlete. The main obstacles for the development of sports can be summarized by the following:

1- Sports being perceived as a luxury lifestyle 2- Society's ignorance related to sports 3- Insufficient financing for less popular sports branches 4- Limited financial support and facilities for professional atheletes 5- Lack of support for young talents who are enthusiastic about sports, especially in developing countries such as Africa 6- Not enough incentives for sports in daily life 7- Health problems 8- Insufficient support for the Paralympics

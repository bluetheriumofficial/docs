#### [Our vision ](our-vision.md#our-vision)

We are working hard to build a better future for the world of sports, and to develop an ecosystem that encourages athletes by replacing existing infrastructures. We want to help people in developing countries and those who have limited access to sports right from our development stage by utilizing the ecosystem we have created.

To achieve this, we plan to organize competitions and events and ensure that we reach people in need.

#### [Technical information ](our-vision.md#technical-information)

Bluetherium was initially created as a smart contract on the BSC network. Our ultimate aim will be to create our own blockchain network with the funding provided from the ICO, where mining will be realized using wearable technologies, and aided by our own sports and health products. Additinal detailed information about these technologies and system infrastructures will be outlined soon in the second versions of our Whitepaper and Roadmap.
